# jaydeepharmaceuticals

This was a school project from back in the year 2010 which if it has enough interest, we can work on and improve the solution. It is a pharmaceutical or chemist system which manages suppliers, drugs, users and point of sale for the drugs. It is based on mysql database and requires some setup to function. It was developed on Java (Swing) desktop application.
